## Build and Run

Import the project into the IntelliJ IDE.

Some sample files are in the `sample` directory; drop 
one file onto the left and one onto the right, then, 
use the buttons to compare the files.

Samples are from Tom Bombadil songs in the first book of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy.
